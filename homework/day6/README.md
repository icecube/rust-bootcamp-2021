# Day 6 Homework

As the last homework assignment, this can also be thought of as a final
project.

Write a web server which serves at least one url and and error page.
The goal is to see how many connections you can serve at once, with
virtual points going to the one(s) with highest throughput and lowest
latency.

A stub is available in `homework/day6/webserver`.

A testing program is available in `homework/day6/webtest`, by running the
`setup.sh` and `run.sh` scripts.  The test gets gradually harder, to discover
the limits of your implementation.
